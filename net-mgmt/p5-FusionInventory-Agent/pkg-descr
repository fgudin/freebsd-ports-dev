fusioninventory-agent is an agent for different inventory server like
FusionInventory for GLPI or cofiguration management server such as Rudder.
It creates a local inventory of the machines (hardware and software) and
sends it to a configured server. It can also write results to a local XML file.
This agent started as a fork of the unified UNIX agent for OCSng but has since
then diverged.
