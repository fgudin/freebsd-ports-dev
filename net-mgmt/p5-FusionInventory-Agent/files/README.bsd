# Known issues and limitations on FreeBSD

Notes based on FusionInventory agent 2.3.15 running on FreeBSD 10.1.

## Deployment module

The state of the deployment functionality on FreeBSD is unknown, thus the
option is not exposed in the port.

## No monitor data

FusionInventory have a way on FreeBSD to obtain EDID (Extended Display 
Idenfication Data) on FreeBSD, additionally the Perl module Parse::EDID
needs to be ported and aded as dependency in order to interpret the binary
EDID data.

## Limited drive information

On FreeBSD not so much data about disk drives can be collected as the agent
doesn't use FreeBSD-specific tools like camcontrol to obtain this data.
