# Known issues and limitations on FreeBSD

Notes based on FusionInventory agent 2.3.15 on FreeBSD 10.1.

## Untested features

Deployment module: The state of the deployment functionality on FreeBSD 
is unknown, thus the option is not exposed in the port.

VMware remote inventory has not been tested on FreeBSD for now.

## Missing features

### No monitor data

FusionInventory has not yet a way on FreeBSD to obtain EDID (Extended 
Display Idenfication Data), additionally the Perl module Parse::EDID needs to
be ported and aded as dependency in order to interpret the binary EDID 
data.

### Limited drive information

On FreeBSD not so much data about disk drives is being collected as the agent
doesn't use FreeBSD-specific tools like camcontrol to obtain this information.
